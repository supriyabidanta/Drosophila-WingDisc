# 🧬 Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Analysis of Drosophila Wing Disc — iEC vs Control
**Polyploidy, Senescence, and Spatial Pathway Enrichment**

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks analyzing single-nucleus RNA-seq data from Drosophila wing imaginal discs.  
The focus is on comparing **induced Endocycling Cells (iECs)** versus **control** cells to uncover senescence-like transcriptional programs and spatial pathway activation.

## 🧬 Biological Context

- **Goal**: Investigate whether polyploid iECs exhibit senescence-like transcriptional changes.
- **Hypothesis**: iECs activate innate immune pathways (Toll, JAK-STAT) and stress responses similar to senescent cells.
- **Significance**: Insights into how polyploidy, tissue regeneration, and cellular senescence intersect biologically.
